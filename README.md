# APK

Android application initiative for the [swarm-space](https://github.com/bobdub/swarm-space.git) project.

## Project Overview
This repository will host the native Android client that brings the swarm-space experience to mobile devices. The goal is to deliver a performant APK with feature parity (or better) compared to the existing web implementation while embracing mobile-first UX patterns.

## Getting Started
1. Review the [project plan](docs/project_plan.md) for milestones and immediate next steps.
2. Clone and audit the upstream swarm-space repository to understand required features and data flows.
3. Set up the Android development environment (Android Studio, Java/Kotlin toolchain, Android SDKs).

## Contributing

- Keep documentation and tests up to date with each change.
- Run linting and test suites before opening pull requests.

## License
