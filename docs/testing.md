# Testing & QA Strategy

Local Gradle execution is not possible, so testing pivots toward web-surface validation and CI-managed native checks.

## Web-Focused Testing
| Layer | Tooling | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Unit tests | Playwright component/unit tests (in swarm-space repo) | Validate PWA enhancements, offline behaviors, and UI logic. |
| Visual regression | Percy, Chromatic, or Playwright screenshots | Guard against layout regressions when iterating on the web client. |
| Performance | Lighthouse CI | Track installability, performance, and PWA compliance metrics. |

## Native Wrapper Testing (CI Only)
- Run `./gradlew lint test` inside CI runners that provision the Android SDK.
- Schedule periodic emulator-based smoke tests to confirm the TWA/WebView shell boots and loads the hosted site.
- Store and version QA-ready APK/AAB artifacts generated by automation for manual device testing.

## Manual QA Checklist
- Exercise the swarm-space experience in Chrome/Edge/Samsung Internet to confirm the PWA install prompt appears.
- Validate offline caching and error messaging for poor connectivity scenarios.
- Verify responsive breakpoints across common Android screen sizes.
- When CI-produced APKs are available, confirm deep links and splash screens behave as expected on physical devices.
