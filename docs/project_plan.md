# APK Project Plan

## Objective
Build an Android application (APK) that wraps and extends the functionality of the [swarm-space](https://github.com/bobdub/swarm-space.git) experience for mobile users.

## Key Milestones
1. **Requirements & Research**
   - Audit the swarm-space repository to understand core user journeys and critical features.
   - Identify any APIs or services that must be accessed from the Android client.
   - Decide whether to build a fully native experience or embed existing web content using a WebView/Compose HTML renderer.

2. **Architecture & Tooling**
   - Select Android build tools (Android Studio + Gradle) and minimum SDK version.
   - Decide between Jetpack Compose or XML-based UI depending on complexity.
   - Define app module structure, package naming, and dependency management strategy.

3. **Prototype Implementation**
   - Scaffold a baseline Android project with application ID, launcher activity, and branding assets.
   - Implement authentication/onboarding flow if required by swarm-space.
   - Integrate key features (e.g., data visualization, interaction controls) with mobile-optimized layouts.

4. **Testing & QA**
   - Configure unit testing (JUnit), UI testing (Espresso/Compose testing), and lint checks.
   - Set up CI pipeline for automated builds and tests.

5. **Deployment**
   - Prepare release signing configuration and Play Store assets.
   - Document release checklist and versioning strategy.

## Immediate Next Steps
- Gather detailed functional requirements from the swarm-space maintainers.
- Confirm target devices and performance expectations.
- Draft initial UI wireframes to validate information architecture.

## Open Questions
- Does the APK need offline capabilities or background sync?
- Are there platform-specific integrations (e.g., sensors, notifications) required beyond the web experience?
- What telemetry/analytics should be captured to monitor usage?
